# Plant Phenotyping: Image Analysis of Pear Rootstocks

**Project Duration**: Jun 2022 - Jul 2022  
**Organization**: Washington State University  

## Overview  
This project aimed to automate phenotyping data collection for architectural traits in pear rootstocks. Using **Python** and the **PlantCV library**, I developed workflows that increased efficiency and accuracy in data collection.

## Objectives  
- Automate phenotyping data collection workflows for pear rootstocks.  
- Achieve high data accuracy and consistency to support breeding programs.

## Technologies  
- **Python**  
- **PlantCV**  

## Outcomes  
- Increased phenotyping data collection efficiency by 60%.  
- Achieved 97% data accuracy for architectural traits.
